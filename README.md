#  SQL Data Cleaning & Analysis Project for orders Dataset 

This project focuses on improving data quality and generating meaningful business insights using SQL. Over several days, I worked with raw datasets to perform data cleaning, validation, and exploratory analysis—turning messy data into actionable information.

## 🔍 1. Data Quality Checks

- Identified missing and duplicate order numbers  
- Validated table structures and data types across **orders**, **products**, and **accounts** tables  
- Converted inconsistent date formats into proper SQL `DATE` types

## 🛠️ 2. Data Cleaning

- Updated incorrect date formats using `STR_TO_DATE()`  
- Modified column types for consistency and accuracy  
- Standardized values to ensure reliable downstream analysis
